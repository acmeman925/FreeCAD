# FreeCAD
After retirment I discovered the world of 3D modeling and printing as a new passion. To begin, I focused on learning the basics of 3D modeling through OpenScad. Once proficient in this software, I transitioned to FreeCad as my primary tool for creating designs. As I continued to refine my skills, I found it essential to have a platform where I could share my work with others.
