This project provides a comprehensive, parametric design for a ball bearing wheel, utilizing FreeCAD. 
By inputting four primary parameters – Inner Diameter (ID), Outer Diameter (OD), Width (W), and Shoulder (S) 
– users can generate a customized wheel configuration.
Additionally, a fifth parameter allows for the specification of a tolerance value, enabling precise 
control over the clearance between the balls. It is essential to note that this design assumes OD - ID <= W, 
ensuring proper alignment and function of the wheel.
By leveraging FreeCAD's powerful parametric capabilities, this design enables users to easily experiment 
with different wheel configurations, optimizing performance and efficiency for their specific applications.
