This directory contains multiple versions of the same design. Begin 
by creating a single face of the cube, and then duplicate it six times 
to form the complete cube. You will need to move and rotate certain 
elements to ensure proper placement of each face. For some designs, 
the Assembly4 Workbench was employed to facilitate assembly. Regardless 
of approach, both methods resulted in the creation of the SGI cube. 
Note that printing the finished product may require support structures. 
A separate file, figureAssemblyV3.FCStd, provides an alternative method: 
print all six identical faces separately and then assemble them into a 
single cube after printing.
